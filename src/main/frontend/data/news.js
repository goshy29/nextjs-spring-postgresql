    title: 'What Are the Benefits of CrossFit and Is It Safe?',

          CrossFit gyms, known as “boxes,” are popping up around the world as it grows in popularity. So, what is CrossFit and what are the health benefits and risks? CrossFit is a form of high-intensity power fitness (HIPT). A CrossFit workout may include dynamic exercises like: plyometric jumping, Olympic weightlifting, kettlebells, explosive bodyweight movements.
          
          May improve physical strength? 
          The high-intensity, multi-joint movements in CrossFit may help you gain muscle strength and stamina. Adding additional weight to your workouts can further increase muscle gain by adding stress to your muscles. You can also continuously challenge your muscles by participating in the workout of the day, which will give your muscles some variety. The workout of the day, or WOD, is a signature part of the CrossFit program. Each day, a new set of exercises is posted. The goal is then to complete as many repetitions of each exercise as possible in a set period of time.

          May help you improve aerobic fitness? 
          CrossFit’s high-intensity power training (HIPT). This type of training may help to increase VO2 max, or the maximum amount of oxygen you can utilize during exercise. However, research has been inconclusive on both the short- and long-term effects of CrossFit on physiological changes and aerobic benefits. More research is needed to understand how CrossFit improves aerobic fitness compared to other forms of exercise.

          Improve agility, balance, and flexibility!
          CrossFit workouts often include functional exercises, or exercises that mimic movements you do in everyday life. Functional movements, such as squats, kettlebell swings, or overhead presses, can help improve agility, balance, and flexibility. They also can reduce your risk for injury and improve your quality of life as you age.

          Burn calories and manage weight!
          CrossFit workouts may help you burn more calories than other workouts. On average, a 195-pound male or 165-pound female will burn 15 to 18 calories per minute and 13 to 15 calories per minute, respectively, during a CrossFit circuit. You may also continue to burn calories during the recovery period. That’s compared to 11 calories per minute and 9 calories per minute during traditional weightlifting using machines.If your goal is weight loss, try following a healthy diet in addition to following a CrossFit exercise regimen.

          Is CrossFit safe?
          CrossFit is a high-intensity form of exercise. Your risk for injuries increases anytime you increase the intensity of your workouts or the amount of weight you’re lifting. Some common CrossFit injuries include: low back pain, rotator cuff tendonitis, Achilles tendonitis, knee injuries, tennis elbow.If you’re new to CrossFit, it’s a smart idea to work with a trained fitness professional that can make sure you’re doing the exercises properly. Having improper form, trying to move through exercises too quickly, or lifting more than you can handle can all lead to injury. Beginners should go at a slower pace and increase weight gradually until your fitness level improves. CrossFit isn’t safe for everyone. 
          
          If you’re pregnant and already practicing CrossFit, it may be fine to continue, but make sure to talk to your doctor first. If you’re pregnant and new to CrossFit, you should wait until after your pregnancy to start. CrossFit isn’t safe if you’re injured or have other serious health concerns, either. Make sure you get cleared by your doctor first or work with a physical therapist before starting CrossFit.If you’re over age 65 and already physically fit, CrossFit may or may not be safe for you to try. Talk to your doctor before starting.

    title: 'Cardio Alternative to Running: Rowing Machine',

          Running is one of the most popular forms of aerobic exercise. It takes center stage in training montages and major motion pictures — but despite being the backdrop to some verymotivational content, running isn’t for everyone. It’s hard to argue against the benefits of running, but it might not be the best option for you or your program. Especially if you hate it.

          The main goal of any cardio session is to crank your heart rate, improve your cardiovascular fitness, or maybe even prepare for competition. Unless you’re training for a running event, however, you don’t actually need to run to accomplish any of these tasks. Get your heart pumping with these eight best cardio alternatives to running.

          Rowing Machine
          The rowing machine is another staple found in almost every gym. It is a lightweight, mobile alternative to running or treadmills that provides all the needed challenges for an excellent cardiovascular workout.

          Unlike the treadmill, the rowing machine incorporates the lower body with a significant contribution from your upper body. It is a fun way to challenge yourself to learn a new technique and provides a great alternative to running for your cardiovascular benefits.

          The rowing machine is a standalone piece of equipment. Aside from the standard suggestions of water and appropriate footwear, you won’t need much as long as your rower has a functioning screen. If it doesn’t, a stopwatch or timer is a good option should high-intensity interval training (HIIT) be on the menu.

          To get the most out of your rowing workouts, there is a solid technique framework to follow. Unlike some other alternatives to running, rowing may take some practice.
          1. Sit down on the rower’s seat, securing each foot in place on the appropriate foot pad.
          2. Bend your knees and slide towards the front of the machine. This is your starting position.
          3. Initiate each repetition by driving with your legs, keeping your core tight and your arms long.
          4. As your legs extend, begin to draw your arms towards your torso completing the rowing portion of the motion.

    title: 'Are Squats Really More “Anabolic” Than Other Exercises?',

          There are a lot of good reasons to squat. For starters, squats are tremendously effective at building muscle in your legs and hips. The squat is also one of your fundamental movement patterns, and mastering it will carry over to other aspects of both your workout routine and out-of-the-gym lifestyle.

          Oh, and they are probably the best overall movement for developing general lower body strength. If you hit the gym hard, whether as an aspiring bodybuilder, powerlifter, or you are just a good old gym rat, you may have also heard squats (particularly, barbell back squats) described as an “anabolic” exercise.

          More specifically, it is a bit of longstanding — and perhaps too prevalent — bodybuilding lore that squats are the most anabolic exercise out there. This begs the question: What even is an anabolic exercise in the first place, and are squats really more anabolic than other exercises you commonly perform? Here is what the science has to say on the matter.

          What Does Anabolic Mean?
          Your body is constantly at work. From digesting the foods you eat to synthesizing and utilizing energy, your internal machinery never takes a rest day. This applies to anabolism and catabolism as well, which broadly refer to building or repairing and breaking down or eliminating organic material, respectively.

          More specifically and among fitness enthusiasts, “anabolic” is used as a general stand-in for, “directly builds or encourages the building of muscle tissue.” Protein powder supplements could be informally considered anabolic because your body requires the amino acids within to facilitate 
          hypertrophy, or muscle growth.

          By extension, gymgoers sometimes refer to aspects of their training as anabolic as a form of gym slang, by which they mean how effective or potent at building muscle an exercise (or entire routine) is.

          Are Squats More Anabolic Than Other Exercises?
          So, why are squats regarded as particularly anabolic (that is, especially effective at stimulating a general muscle-building atmosphere)? 

          When you perform strength training, you do more than simply tax your muscle tissue. All sorts of metabolic interactions take place during and after your workout. Lifting weights elicits a response from your endocrine system, elevating your testosterone levels in the process.

          The harder you work, or the more work you do, the more intense this hormonal response is, and the more testosterone is produced as a consequence.

          So, logically, it kind of makes sense that a large compound exercise like the squat would stimulate more testosterone than something “smaller” like a biceps curl. That is the core idea behind squats being more “anabolic” than other exercises. But does it stand up to scientific scrutiny?
